# Disease-Classification-Using-Genetic-and-clinical-Dataset
Overview
This project uses machine learning to classify tumors as Malignant (M) or Benign (B) based on clinical and genetic data.
Steps
- Preprocessed the dataset to clean and prepare the data.
- Trained a Random Forest Classifier on 80% of the data.
- Evaluated the model using accuracy and a confusion matrix.

Results
- Accuracy: ~97%
- Confusion matrix visualization for predictions.

Tools
- Python libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn.
